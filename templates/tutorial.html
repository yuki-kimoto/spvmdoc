  <h3 id="tutorial-install">SPVM Installation</h3>

  <p>
    SPVM is a CPAN module. It can be installed using cpan or cpanm.
  </p>
<pre>
cpan SPVM
cpanm SPVM

    Calculate the sum of arrays
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    As a first simple example, let's find the sum of arrays.
  </p>
  <h4>Create SPVM module</h4>
  <p>
    Create a file called "MyMath.spvm" in the lib directory. <b>SPVM source files have the extension “.spvm”</b>. Describe the following contents.
  </p>
<pre>
# lib/MyMath.spvm
package MyMath {
  sub sum :int ($nums :int[]) {
    my $total = 0;
    for (my $i = 0; $i <@$nums; $i++) {
      $total += $nums->[$i];
    }
    return $total;
  }
}
</pre>
  
  <p>
    SPVM uses <b>package syntax</b> to create packages. It has the same syntax as Perl's package block syntax.
  </p>
<pre>
# Package syntax
package MyMath {

}
</pre>
  <p>
    You can <b>define a subroutine</b> inside a package block.
  </p>
<pre>
package MyMath {
  sub sum :int ($nums :int[]) {

  }
}
</pre>
  
  <p>
    SPVM is a statically typed language, so describe the return type, argument name and argument type in the <b>subroutine declaration</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The return value is "int type". The argument is an "int type array". The <b>int type represents a 32-bit signed integer</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's look at the part where the sum of the arrays is calculated.
  </p>
<pre>
my $total = 0;
for (my $i = 0; $i <@$nums; $i++) {
  $total += $nums->[$i];
}

return $total;
</pre>
  <p>
    The way the sum is calculated looks exactly like what I wrote with the for statement in Perl.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this way, SPVM has one of the characteristics that it can be described in the same syntax as M<b>Perl</b>. It is designed to minimize the burden of learning the new syntax for Perl users.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can omit the type using <b>type inference</b> in the variable declaration.
  </p>
<pre>
my $total = 0;
</pre>
  <p>
    SPVM's type inference can omit the type declaration on the left side when the type on the right side is fixed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the numeric literal "0" is "int type", the type of "$total" is also "int type". It has the same meaning as described below.
  </p>
<pre>
my $total : int = 0;
</pre>
  <p>
    <b>Array length</b> can be obtained by using "@".
  </p>
<pre>
@$nums
</pre>
  <p>
    In SPVM, there is no context and "@" always returns the length of the array.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, let's call a subroutine written in SPVM from the Perl side.
  <p>
  <h4>Call SPVM module</h4>
  <p>
    Create a file called "sum.pl" and describe the following contents.
  </p>
  <p>
    Call the "sum" subroutine of the "MyMath" package written in SPVM to calculate the sum of the arrays.
  </p>
<pre>
use FindBin;
use lib "$FindBin::Bin/lib";

use SPVM'MyMath';

my $sp_nums = SPVM::new_int_array([3, 6, 8, 9]);

my $total = MyMath->sum($sp_nums);

print $total ."\n";
</pre>
  <p>
    First, add the <b>lib directory to the module search path</b>.
  </p>
<pre>
# add lib directory to module search path
use FindBin;
use lib "$FindBin::Bin/lib";
</pre>
  <p>
    Then <b>load the SPVM module</b>.
  </p>
<pre>
# Load SPVM module
use SPVM'MyMath';
</pre>
  <p>
    You can load the SPVM module with the description "use SPVM'SPVM module name'".
  </p>
  <p>
    Then <b>create an array of SPVMs</b>.
  </p>
<pre>
# Int type array creation
my $sp_nums = SPVM::new_int_array([3, 6, 8, 9]);
</pre>
  <p>
    You can use the <b>SPVM::new_int_array function</b> to create a SPVM int array by passing an array reference.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Call the sum subroutine of the MyMath package</b>.
  </p>
<pre>
# Call the sum subroutine of the MyMath package
my $total = MyMath->sum($sp_nums);
</pre>
  <p>
    Note that <b>SPVM subroutine calls are Perl class method calls. </b>It cannot be called with the absolute name MyMath::sub.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The return value of the sum function is "int type", but the SPVM integer type is automatically converted to the Perl scalar type.
  </p>
